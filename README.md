Just a show and tell 

At the moment, folders contain singular projects with specific datasets. There is somewhat a narrative, and the complexity increases with index. For example project 1. Iris, will have a more introductory tone than project 2. Wine and so on.  

When the project isnt explicitly numbered it can/will be a little disorganised, this is code/a project in which it is in archive and will likely contain no documentation, no report, and will just be a pile of code spanning multiple languages. Scripts_Backup is a good example of this, as it is effectively a matlab library for problems ive encounterred in the past. Its a shorthand so i can "include all to path" and receive functionality that i otherwise wouldnt be able to get in matlab.
